## DayBreak v1.0
DayBreak is a videogame made by two students of second year of the Degree in Video Game Design and Development at CITM (UPC School).
Is a platformer game where the player must scape from its alien city in destruction because of a human invasion, avoid obstacles in his path and enemies.

## Instructions & Controls

-Shoot with SPACEBAR

-K to save a Checkpoint (only if you have more than 5 coins). This will also fill your life again.

Each 2 flyer enemies killed or each walker enemy killed, you have one more coin! Also you can get 5 score points from flyers and 10 from walkers. Can you beat your own record?

Test yourself to pass the level in the minimum time possible with the highest score!

To pass each level, there are some platforms that are unactive. To activate them and be able to pass over them, you must press a button!
Those platforms can be also obstacles that must be deactivated by passing through a Ray in order to pass the level.
