## DayBreak

DayBreak is a platformer game done by two students for Development Subject in Videogame Design and Development carreer of CITM at Universitat Polit√®cnica
de Catalunya.

The game is about an alien that must escape from his planet because humans have arrived to conquer and started to destroy everything. But
it's not that easy, in his path he will find enemies that will try to kill him and he will have to find his way out from places that
have active/unactive platforms that obstaculize the path to success.

DayBreak is done with Tiled program, has 2 levels and save/load support. Also, the game supports pathfinding for enemies.

The game is licensed under an MIT License.

## Game Main Core

The structure was made with modules that manages different elements of the game. Each one has, appart from their own, common methods for
awake, preupdate, update, postupdate and cleanup. App is a module that manages all the others and it calls all that methods making
each module work when it must.

All regarding to game metadata (paths of assets, character and enemies characteristics...) are loaded with XML files to avoid hardcoding,
avoid confusing code and build an easier work flow.

### UI System

For the UI system, we would liked to make a system similar to the Entities one, but we didn't had much time and we had to adapt the UI needs to the time we had.

UI system has a base module which works as a manger for all the UI Elements. From here, we build a header to generalize the UI elements that has a UI_Element factory that assigns, from an enumeration, a type (for example, button) and a logic (for instance, play or load) for each element. Then the UI_Elements are created mostly from the Scene module and added to a list of UI_Elements.

The appropiate module (the one that needs to create a UI Element, for example, the scene), will perform element's physical logic knowing it's type and the logic that must do.
This system must be improved and it's on the way.

As you may see in the image, each element has a pointer to its parent, so we set a hierarchy or a tree-like structure.

### Innovations
* Platforms that must be activated or deactivated to pass the level
* Textures Flipping
* Player characteristics loaded from XML file.
* Player and enemies shooting
* Music made by us from other base music

## Gameplay & Instructions

You must pass through each level and get to the door that will take you out!

Move left and right with A and D keys and jump with W. You can also shoot with SPACEBAR.

Each 2 flyer enemies killed or each walker enemy killed, you have one more coin! Also you can get 5 score points from flyers and 10 from walkers. Can you beat your own record?

Test yourself to pass the level in the minimum time possible with the highest score!

To pass each level, there are some platforms that are unactive. To activate them and be able to pass over them, you must press a button!
Those platforms can be also obstacles that must be deactivate by passing through the ray in order to pass the level.

ESC key inside the game pauses it and opens an in-game menu (also you can use the button in the corner).
